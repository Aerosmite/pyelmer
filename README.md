# PyElmer

## Project description

The pyelmer package provides a simple object-oriented way to set up [Elmer FEM](http://www.elmerfem.org/) simulations from python.

Some utility-functions for pre-processing using the [gmsh python API](https://pypi.org/project/gmsh/), execution of ElmerGrid and ElmerSolver, and some post-processing routines are provided. Some default simulation settings, solvers, and materials are available.

## Prerequisites

Pyelmer is written in Python 3.7. To run simulations, an Elmer executable is required. As pyelmer was developed to be used with gmsh, an installation of this package is required. Simulation settings, solver, and materials are stored in yaml-files. Therefore pyelmer depends on pyyaml. Furthermore, matplotlib is used for visualization.

```shell
pip install --upgrade gmsh
pip install --upgrade pyyaml
pip install --upgrade matplotlib
```

## Installation

The package is not yet listed on [pypi](https://pypi.org/), so pip install pyelmer does not work. To install pyelmer you need to clone this repository and install it in development mode. This is done with the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nemocrys/pyelmer
cd pyelmer
pip install -e ./
```

Alternatively, you can build your own wheel and install it with the tool of your choice. More information about this can be found [here](https://python-packaging-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_py.html).

## Basic principles

The basic working principle of pyelmer is the representation of sif-file entries in dictionaries. Each section of the sif-file is represented by instances of the classes

- *Solver*
- *Equation*
- *Material*
- *Body*
- *Boundary*
- *BodyForce*
- *InitialCondition*

The parameters of e.g. a material are stored in

```python
material.data = {
    'Density': 1.1885,
    'Heat Capacity': 1006.4,
    'Heat Conductivity': 0.025873
}
```

An object of the class *Simulation* is used to manage all members of the sif-file:

```python
import pyelmer.sif as elmer

# simulation object
sim = elmer.Simulation()

# create material and add it to sim
air = elmer.Material(sim, 'air')
air.data = {
    # material data here
}

# add solvers, equations, bodies, ...
heat_solver = elmer.Solver(sim, 'heat')
heat_solver.data = {
    # solver data here
}
# ...

# write sif-file
sim.write_sif('./simulation_directory/')
```

## Examples

The following example shows the setup of a simple heat transfer simulation. The domain consists of two quadratic bodies stacked on top of each other, the lower one is water and the upper one is air. At the bottom a constant temperature of 80째C, and at the top a constant temperature of 20째C is set. You may consider this as a very simple model of the heat distribution when boiling water in a pot:

```python
import os

from pyelmer import elmer
from pyelmer import execute
from pyelmer.gmsh_utils import add_physical_group, get_boundaries_in_box

###############
# set up working directory
sim_dir = './examples/simdata'

if not os.path.exists(sim_dir):
    os.mkdir(sim_dir)

###############
# geometry modeling using gmsh
gmsh.initialize()
gmsh.option.setNumber("General.Terminal", 1)
gmsh.model.add('heat-transfer-2d')
factory = gmsh.model.occ

# main bodies
water =  factory.addRectangle(0, 0, 0, 1, 1)
air = factory.addRectangle(0, 1, 0, 1, 1)

# create connection between the two bodies
factory.synchronize()
factory.fragment([(2, water)], [(2, air)])

# add physical groups
factory.synchronize()
ph_water = add_physical_group(2, [water], 'water')
ph_air = add_physical_group(2, [air], 'air')

# detect boundaries 
line = get_boundaries_in_box(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, water)
ph_bottom = add_physical_group(1, [line], 'bottom')
line = get_boundaries_in_box(0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, air)
ph_top = add_physical_group(1, [line], 'top')

# create mesh
gmsh.model.mesh.setSize(gmsh.model.getEntities(0), 0.1)
gmsh.model.mesh.generate(2)

# show mesh & export
gmsh.fltk.run()  # comment this line out if your system doesn't support the gmsh GUI
gmsh.write(sim_dir + '/case.msh2')  # use legacy file format msh2 for elmer grid

###############
# elmer setup
sim = elmer.load_simulation('2D_steady')

air = elmer.load_material('air', sim)
water = elmer.load_material('water', sim)

solver_heat = elmer.load_solver('HeatSolver', sim)
solver_output = elmer.load_solver('ResultOutputSolver', sim)
eqn = elmer.Equation(sim, 'main', [solver_heat])

T0 = elmer.InitialCondition(sim, 'T0', {'Temperature': 273.15})

bdy_water = elmer.Body(sim, 'water', [ph_water])
bdy_water.material = water
bdy_water.initial_condition = T0
bdy_water.equation = eqn

bdy_air = elmer.Body(sim, 'air', [ph_air])
bdy_air.material = air
bdy_air.initial_condition = T0
bdy_air.equation = eqn

bndry_bottom = elmer.Boundary(sim, 'bottom', [ph_bottom])
bndry_bottom.fixed_temperature = 353.15  # 80 째C
bndry_top = elmer.Boundary(sim, 'top', [ph_top])
bndry_top.fixed_temperature = 293.15  # 20 째C

sim.write_startinfo(sim_dir)
sim.write_sif(sim_dir)

##############
# execute ElmerGrid & ElmerSolver
execute.run_elmer_grid(sim_dir, 'case.msh2')
execute.run_elmer_solver(sim_dir)

###############
# scan log for errors and warnings
err, warn, stats = scan_logfile(sim_dir)
print('Errors:', err)
print('Warnings:', warn)
print('Statistics:', stats)
```

An alternative version of this example, without using the pre-defined materials and solvers, can be found in the examples folder.

Further examples, e.g. for the postprocessing or using more complex setups, will hopefully follow soon.
